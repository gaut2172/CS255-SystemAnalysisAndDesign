# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a hypothetical startup company that wants to help people pass their DMV driver’s tests. DriverPass wants a new system that will help students learn driver knowledge and skills. The system will offer online classes, online practice tests, and appointments for driving lessons.

# What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did an exceptional job interpreting the interview during requirements determination. The “objectives and goals” section completely illustrates what DriverPass stakeholders want from the new system. The “requirements” section is detailed enough for any tester to create test cases. I excelled with deliverables in the design document: developers have a great foundation to work with from the Class diagram, and non-technical individuals can easily grasp how the new system will work from looking at my Use Case and Activity diagrams.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had more time, I would redesign the Staff class and its three subclasses in my Class diagram. The fact that the Secretary, ItStaff, and Admin classes have no distinct attributes may point to a poor design. However, this could be quickly resolved by using only the Staff class with a role attribute that could have a value of “secretary”, “IT Staff”, or “Admin”. This could be a better solution to the problem while still fulfilling the role-based authorization scheme required by DriverPass.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is extremely important to consider user needs when designing as to create a product that has upmost value to the customer and to add to SDLC efficiencies. If the design does not adhere to customer requirements and user needs, the implementation of the design will compound the poor design unless the project is course-corrected. By that time, the initial design wasted the companies’ time and money.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I think the most important aspect of designing software is to constantly review requirements and analysis ideas that were developed during the system analysis phase of the SDLC. This can be from documentation such as a Business Requirements Document or talking with stakeholders and users. Keeping in constant contact with customers and users promotes good design and a final product that meets user requirements. <br /><br />
In the future, I plan to have good communication with technical and nontechnical interested parties during analysis and design. I also plan on utilizing UML diagrams whenever my team can benefit from design presentations.
