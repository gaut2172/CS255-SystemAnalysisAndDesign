# CS-255-SystemAnalysisAndDesign

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a hypothetical startup company that wants to help people pass their DMV driver’s tests. DriverPass wants a new system that will help students learn driver knowledge and skills. The system will offer online classes, online practice tests, and appointments for driving lessons.

# What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did an exceptional job interpreting the interview during requirements determination. The “objectives and goals” section completely illustrates what DriverPass stakeholders want from the new system. The “requirements” section is detailed enough for any tester to create test cases. I excelled with deliverables in the design document: developers have a great foundation to work with from the Class diagram, and non-technical individuals can easily grasp how the new system will work from looking at my Use Case and Activity diagrams.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?


# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
